\begin{abstract}
Existing datasets of ice water path (IWP) based on passive observations 
either show a clear low bias compared to radar retrievals or are 
completely empirical. It is here shown that much more accurate 
physically-based passive retrievals are possible. The high-frequency 
channels of the GMI radiometer are used for demonstration. The progress 
is mainly achieved by detailed radiative transfer simulations, that 
closely mimic the real observations statistically. A novel aspect is 
that particle orientation is considered and polarisation signatures in 
the observations can be exploited. The simulations are used as input to 
a machine learning retrieval algorithm. Both the simulations and the 
inversions are made in a Bayesian fashion. As a consequence, reasonably 
complete distributions of IWP are provided and the retrievals can be 
considered as all-sky in contrast to most other datasets, limited to 
either the low or high end of the IWP distribution. Example results and 
applications are shown. For example, a clear diurnal variation of IWP in 
the Tropics is confirmed. So far satellite-based cloud radars are only 
nadir-pointing while these passive retrievals have a swath width of ? 
km, and this broad coverage should provide opportunities to assess model 
cloud parametrisations in new manners

\introduction  %% \introduction

Ice Clouds have a profound impact the Earth's radiation balance. They reflect the short and long wave radiation and emit long wave radiation contributing to the Earthâ€™s energy balance and hydrological cycle \citep{liou:influ:86}. The total radiative forcing is dependent both on the microphysical and macrophysical properties, such as, the spatial distribution of ice particles, particle orientation, ice water content, etc. However, due to the complex vertical and spatio-temporal heterogeneity associated with ice clouds, the knowledge on the global distribution of atmospheric ice is deficient and not well captured by the models \citep{wilson:theim:00}. Significant uncertainties, in both meteorological and climate models, are inflicted by the simplifications introduced to resolve the complex structures \citep{reinhardt:impac:04}.

Ice water content (IWC)  is a key variable used to measure the atmospheric ice. It is defined as the bulk mass of ice in the atmosphere and the column integrated bulk mass is the ice water path (IWP). The existing space based retrieval systems use observations from either active or passive microwave sensors or exploit the synergies between the two. The 94\,\,GHz radar onboard Cloudsat is the first active sensor to give information on the vertical structure of clouds on a global scale. The synergy of the radar and CALIPSO lidar is the most accurate observation system providing global distribution of atmospheric ice, especially for the tropical ice clouds \citep{protat:theev:10}. This combination can sense ice hydrometeors ranging from thin cirrus to precipitating ice \citep{stephens:cloud:18}. However, the limited spatio-temporal sampling cannot fully resolve the  variability of atmospheric ice on both local and global scales.

Despite the lack of scanning capability and single-frequency sensor, the researchers have benefited from tremendously from Cloudsat. Multiple IWP and IWC retreival algorithms based on passive sensors but constrained by Cloudsat observations have evolved. For example, \citet{gong:cloud:14} describe an empirical model to retreive IWP from Microwave Humidty Sounder (MHS) high frequency channels. The Synergistic Passive Atmospheric Retrieval Experiment-ICE (Spare-Ice) product \citet{holl:spare:14} is another empirical attempt which combines optical,microwave and infrared sensors to retrieve IWP. The usage infrared sensors can account for smaller ice particles in the cloud, they cannot sense the entire water column. 

The global atmopsheric ice estimates from passive microwave sensors have proven to be successful capturing the diurnal cycle and interseasonal fluctuations. However, the inconsistency among different cloud ice observations leads to model uncertainties. A detailed comparison of different space borne IWP measurements by \citet{duncan:anupd:18, eliasson:asses:11} highlights that large discrepancies exist between different IWP estimates as the space-borne remote sensing techniques still cannot fully resolve the atmospheric ice properties. The limitations associated with sensor sensitivities and the oversimplified microphysical assumptions are mostly to blame. The sensor limitations will be overcome to a certain extent with the launch of new sensors like Ice Cloud Imager (ICI). ICI will will sense ice-clouds using sub-millimter(sub-mm) wavelengths and shall shall bridge the sensitivity gap between microwave and infrared sensors. However, the improvements in microphysical assumptions has seen slow progress. The physically based retrieval techniques associate the simulated brightness temperatures to the ice cloud structures, but most radiative transfer based retrieval algorithms, focusing on ice clouds, assume spherical or randomly oriented hydrometeors, e.g. \citep{evans:icecl:05, Zhao:retri:02}. The simplifications are often introduced to reduce computational loads, but at the same time, properties of ice-hydrometeors are still not fully understood. The ice hydrometeors exhibit dichroism effects resulting in polarization difference (PD) between the radiances measured by horizontal(H) and vertical(V) polarizations. The PD exhibited by oriented particles is generally higher than the randomly oriented ones. Constraining the microphysical assumptions to one or few habits and neglecting  orientation effects contributes to a non-zero bias in the retrievals. High inaccuracies also are connected to areas with large PD. For example, \citet{gong:micro:17} and \citep{miao:thepo:03} argue that retrieval of cloud ice has a strong connection to the polarimetric difference introduced by oriented particles, particularly for regions with convective outflow. 

Zeroing on an ice model incorporating accurate ice model remains a challenge, however, microwave sensors measuring different polarizations can help in inferring the properties of ice hydrometeors. The space borne sensors can provide accurate measures of the polarimetric differences and their potential in retrieval of ice cloud properties have have been long recognised. For example, \citep{coy:sensi:20}, have shown  that incorporating polarimetric measurements improve the retrievals of ice cloud microphysics such as particle effective diameter (D$_{eff}$), while \citep{hioki:degre:16} analyse the ice particle surface roughness from polarimetric observations. However, there is a general lack of  IWC and IWP retrieval methods taking PD into account.

In this study, we explore the benefits of incorporating polarimetric measurements for retrievals of IWP using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). We aim for physical based measurements of IWP from passive microwave instruments, which can be bias-free and better performing than existing reanalyses and satellite based products. Currently, GMI is the only sensor which senses in dual polarisation mode above 100\,\,GHz. The Bayesian retrieval algorithm utilized by GPM for precipiation is also used for compute IWP from precipitating hydrometeors. The ice hydrometeors are not covered as the apriori database is generated for hydrometeor profiles covered by GPM Dual Precipitraion radar (DPR), which is sensitive only to precipitating hydrometeors. 

We apply a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) \citep{pfreundschuh:aneur:18} to retrieve IWP from a database of atmospheric profiles generated using radiative transfer model. As a first step, a database representing the GMI measurements for a variety of atmospheric conditions is created. We avoid the ice-scattering calculations but the impact of polarisation is introduced using the scheme proposed by \citet{barlakas:intro:21}. They had introduced a simple scaling factor to mimic the effects of hydrometeor orientation. In this study, the simple scaling factor is extended to cover different magnitudes of polarimetric signatures observed by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) 166 GHz channels. Further, the retrieval is applied to real GMI measurements and the results are compared against the existing IWP observation sets. We investigate the sensitivity of retrieved IWP to polarization differences and  quantify the errors arsing due to assumption of unpolarised signals. 

\section{Data}

\subsection{GPM GMI}
The GPM GMI instrument is a conical microwave radiometer, which provides a near global coverage of the precipitation estimates. It has a swath of 885\,\,km  and an earth incidence angle of 52.8$^{\circ}$. It instrument has thirteen microwave channels ranging from 10\,\,GHz to 183\,\,GHz which are sensitive to the different forms of precipitation. In this study, we use only the four high frequency measurements between 166 GHz and 183 GHz (Table~\ref{tab:gmi_channels}). These channels are sensitive to the precipitating ice and water vapour.
\subsubsection{L1B radiances}

In this study, the retrieval is made from L1B radiances. The details of L1B algorithm are found in \citet{}. L1B radiances are gelocated and calibrated Level 0 counts at native resolution. 

\subsubsection{L3 IWP product}
For comparison, we also utilize GMI IWP product.

\section{Radiative transfer simulations}

\subsection{ARTS}
\label{sec:arts}

\subsection{Polarisation correction}
\label{sec:scaling_factor}
The simulations cover four GMI channels: 166V, 166H, 183$\pm$3
and 183$\pm$7\,GHz. The dbZ based
system described in \citet{ekelund:using:20} is followed. The
main inputs are radar reflectivities from CloudSat and ERA5 reanalysis data.
Hydrometeor particles are assumed to be ARO (Sect.~\ref{sec:arts}), where the
approximation from \citet{barlakas:intro:21} is extended to operate with 
a random scaling factor (instead of a fixed one), as well as being applied also
on the CloudSat radar data.

\subsection{Snow emissivity model}
%label{sec:snow_emissivity}
The emissivities over land and water are taken from climatologies. However, for
snow and sea ice surface types (identified using ERA5 data) an empirical snow
and ice emissivity model was developed, based on the studies of
\citet{harlow:2009:milli, harlow:2012:tundr} and \citet{hewison:2002:airbo}. If
$\epsilon_{193}, \epsilon_{159}$ represents the emissivities for 193\,GHz and
159\,GHz respectively, then
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{193}& = \min({N(\mu_{193}, \sigma_{193}^{2}), 1});\, \mu_{193} = 0.78, \sigma_{193} = 0.07 \label{eq:1}\\
\epsilon_{159}& = \min(\epsilon_{193} - N(\mu_{159}, \sigma_{159}^{2}), 1) ;\,  \mu_{159} = 0.02, \sigma_{159} = 0.02\,\label{eq:2}
\end{align}
where, $N(\mu, \sigma^{2})$ represents the standard normal distribution with
mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. The differences between the
horizontal and vertical polarisations for both frequencies are 
approximated through a uniform random distribution.

\begin{align}
d_{159}& = U(a_1, b_1) ;\, a_1 = 0.005, b_1 = 0.055\\
d_{193}& = d_{159} - U(a_2, b_2) ;\, a_2 = 0.015, b_2 = 0.025 \,
\end{align}
where, $U(a, b)$ represents a uniform distribution between a and b.

Atmlab is needed to run these files

To test, copy demo_iwc2tb to another folder and edit copy.

Edit path settings in the copy.

P.wfolder is the "work folder", i.e. a folder of temporary character.
A high number of folders will be placed in this folder. For testing,
just create one manually. Note that each matlab process needs its own
folder, otherwise files can be overwitten. For later operational work
a folder can be created (inside a function) as
  workfolder = create_tmpfolder;
  cu = onCleanup( @()delete_tmpfolder( workfolder ) );

Other paths should hopefully be self explanatory.

Single scattering data (as "standard habits") are found at
Dendrite/SSDB/ArtsScatDbase/ArtsScatDbase_v1.1.0/StandardHabits/FullSet
Maybe a good idea to copy the habits you use to the local drive
